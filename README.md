For this IMC Prosperity 2 Competition, we had a group of Wissal and Oscar.
We will first explain the algorithmic rounds and then the manual rounds.

For the algo round 1:
We had two assets, The first asset, Amethyst, demonstrated a relatively stable price range, oscillating around a mean of approximately 10,000 Seashells. The asset's price fluctuated between a high of 10,005 Seashells and a low of 9,995 Seashells. This narrow price range indicated low volatility, but there were noticeable clusters of volatility that presented potential profit opportunities. However, the lack of a robust data storage framework prevented us from fully capitalizing on these fluctuations. 
For the second asset, Seafruit, our initial strategy was to engage in either trend-following or market-making around the price oscillations. Trend-following would have involved identifying and capitalizing on the directions of price movements, whereas market-making would have focused on capturing the spread between buy and sell prices during oscillations. Similar to our experience with Amethyst, the absence of a comprehensive data storage framework restricted our ability to deploy these strategies effectively.
We then decided to trade Amethyst by simply market-making and stay away from Starfruit.
We made a mediocre but very consistent return of 12,956 Seashells.

For algo round 2:
The second round introduced a new asset, Orchids, which presented a more complex set of variables influencing its price dynamics, including Shipping Costs, Export and Import Tariffs, Sunlight, and Humidity. This round tested our ability to integrate and analyze multiple data streams in our trading strategy. Building on the lessons from the first round, we developed a simple yet effective data storage framework. This allowed us to maintain and access historical data relevant to the factors influencing Orchids' prices. We utilized linear regression analysis to predict price movements based on the stored data, focusing on whether to buy or sell the asset.
This worked very consistently and we were able to secure 6,686 Seashells.

For algo round 3:
In round three we where introduced to the Gift basket which included 4 Chocolates, 6 Strawberries, a
